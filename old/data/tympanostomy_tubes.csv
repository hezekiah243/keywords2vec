"\"Meta-analysis of tympanostomy tube sequelae.\",\"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of tympanostomy tube sequelae based on systematic review of published case series and randomized studies. DATA SOURCES: English-language MEDLINE search from 1966 through April 1999 with manual reference search of proceedings, articles, reports, and guidelines. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies with otitis media as the primary indication for tube placement. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data from 134 articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Transient otorrhea occurred in 16% of patients in the postoperative period and later in 26%; recurrent otorrhea occurred in 7.4% of patients and chronic otorrhea in 3.8%. Sequelae of indwelling tubes included obstruction (7% of ears), granulation tissue (5%), premature extrusion (3.9%), and medial displacement (0.5%). Sequelae after tube extrusion included tympanosclerosis (32%), focal atrophy (25%), retraction pocket (3.1%), cholesteatoma (0.7%), and perforation (2.2% with short-term tubes, 16.6% with long-term tubes). Meta-analysis showed that long-term tubes increased the relative risk of perforation by 3.5 (95% CI, 1.5 to 7.1) and cholesteatoma by 2.6 (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.4). Similarly, intubation increased the relative risk of tympanosclerosis by 3.5 (95% CI, 2.6 to 4.9) and focal atrophy by 1.7 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.7) over nonintubated control ears (baseline tympanosclerosis and atrophy rates of 10% and 14%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sequelae of tympanostomy tubes are common but are generally transient (otorrhea) or cosmetic (tympanosclerosis, focal atrophy). Nonetheless, the high incidence suggests a need for ongoing otologic surveillance of all patients with indwelling tubes and for a reasonable time period after tube extrusion. Long-term tubes should be used on a selective and individualized basis.\""
"\"Adenoidectomy for otitis media in children\",\"BACKGROUND: Adenoidectomy, surgical removal of the adenoids, is a common ENT operation worldwide in children with otitis media. A systematic review on the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in this specific group has not previously been performed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of adenoidectomy versus non-surgical management or tympanostomy tubes in children with otitis media. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 March 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing adenoidectomy, with or without tympanostomy tubes, versus non-surgical management or tympanostomy tubes only in children with otitis media. The primary outcome studied was the proportion of time with otitis media with effusion (OME). Secondary outcomes were mean number of episodes, mean number of days per episode and per year, and proportion of children with either acute otitis media (AOM) or otitis media with effusion (OME), as well as mean hearing level. Tertiary outcome measures included atrophy of the tympanic membrane, tympanosclerosis, retraction of the pars tensa and pars flaccid and cholesteatoma. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen randomised controlled trials (2712 children) studying the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with otitis media were evaluated. Most of these trials were too heterogeneous to pool in a meta-analysis. Loss to follow up varied from 0% to 63% after two years. Adenoidectomy in combination with a unilateral tympanostomy tube has a beneficial effect on the resolution of OME (risk difference (RD) 22% (95% CI 12% to 32%) and 29% (95% CI 19% to 39%) for the non-operated ear at six and 12 months, respectively (n = 3 trials)) and a very small (< 5 dB) effect on hearing, compared to a unilateral tympanostomy tube only. The results of studies of adenoidectomy with or without myringotomy versus non-surgical treatment or myringotomy only, and those of adenoidectomy in combination with bilateral tympanostomy tubes versus bilateral tympanostomy tubes only, also showed a small beneficial effect of adenoidectomy on the resolution of the effusion. The latter results could not be pooled due to large heterogeneity of the trials. Regarding AOM, the results of none of the trials including this outcome indicate a significant beneficial effect of adenoidectomy. The trials were too heterogeneous to pool in a meta-analysis. The effects of adenoidectomy on changes of the tympanic membrane or cholesteatoma have not been studied. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review shows a significant benefit of adenoidectomy as far as the resolution of middle ear effusion in children with OME is concerned. However, the benefit to hearing is small and the effects on changes in the tympanic membrane are unknown. The risks of operating should be weighed against these potential benefits. The absence of a significant benefit of adenoidectomy on AOM suggests that routine surgery for this indication is not warranted.\""
"\"Interventions for the prevention of postoperative ear discharge after insertion of ventilation tubes (grommets) in children\",\"BACKGROUND: Grommets are frequently inserted in children's ears for acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. A common complication is postoperative ear discharge (otorrhoea). A wide range of treatments are used to prevent the discharge, but there is no consensus on whether or not intervention is necessary nor which is the most effective intervention. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of prophylactic interventions, both topical and systemic, in reducing the incidence of otorrhoea following the surgical insertion of grommets in children. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 3 July 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of prophylactic interventions against placebo/control and/or with other prophylactic interventions for postoperative otorrhoea in children. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. The outcome data were dichotomous for all the included trials. We calculated individual and pooled risk ratios (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. We also calculated the numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTB). MAIN RESULTS: We found 15 eligible RCTs (2476 children, aged from four months to 17 years). We graded seven RCTs as being at a low risk of bias (n = 926 children) and for an eighth RCT we also graded two of the arms as being at a low risk of bias. We graded the other seven trials as being at a high risk of bias. For a single application at surgery, there was evidence from two low risk of bias trials that at two weeks postoperatively the risk of otorrhoea was reduced by multiple saline washouts (from 30% to 16%; RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 1.00; NNTB 7; one RCT; 140 children) and antibiotic/steroid ear drops (from 9% to 1%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.57; NNTB 13; one RCT; 322 ears). A meta-analysis of two low risk of bias trials (222 ears) failed to find an effect of a single application of antibiotic/steroid ear drops at four to six weeks postoperatively. For a prolonged application of an intervention, there was evidence from four low risk of bias trials that the risk of otorrhoea was reduced two weeks postoperatively by antibiotic ear drops (from 15% to 8%; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.97; NNTB 15; one RCT; 372 children), antibiotic/steroid ear drops (from 39% to 5%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.31; NNTB 3; one RCT; 200 children), aminoglycoside/steroid ear drops (from 15% to 5%; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74; NNTB 11; one RCT; 356 children) or oral antibacterial agents/steroids (from 39% to 5%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.51; NNTB 3; one RCT; 77 children). Only one trial assessed the secondary outcome of ototoxicity, but no effect was found. There were no trials that assessed quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our review found that each of the following were effective at reducing the rate of otorrhoea up to two weeks following surgery: (1) multiple saline washouts at surgery, (2) a single application of topical antibiotic/steroid drops at surgery, (3) a prolonged application of topical drops (namely antibiotic ear drops, antibiotic/steroid eardrops or aminoglycoside/steroid ear drops) and (4) a prolonged application of oral antibacterial agents/steroids. However, the rate of otorrhoea between RCTs varied greatly and the higher the rates of otorrhoea within a RCT, the smaller the NNTB for therapy. We conclude that if a surgeon has a high rate of postoperative otorrhoea in children then either saline irrigation or antibiotic ear drops at the time of surgery would significantly reduce that rate. If topical drops are chosen, it is suggested that to reduce the cost and potential for ototoxic damage this be a single application at the time of surgery and not prolonged thereafter.\""
"\"The management of otitis media with early routine insertion of grommets in children with cleft palate--a systematic review.\",\"Objective: To determine whether early routine grommet insertion in children with cleft palate has a beneficial effect on hearing and speech and language development compared with conservative management. Design: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, case series, and prospective and historical cohort studies. Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measure was the effect of early routine grommet placement on the degree of conductive hearing loss. Secondary outcome measures included differences in hearing level, possible side effects, speech and language development, and quality of life. Results: We identified 368 citations for review. From a review of the titles, 34 potentially relevant papers were selected. Of these, 18 studies met our inclusion criteria, including eight case series, six historical cohort studies, three prospective cohort studies, and one randomized trial. Most studies were either small or of poor quality or both. The results of the studies were contradictory, with some studies suggesting early placement of grommets was beneficial and others reporting there was no benefit. Conclusions: There is currently insufficient evidence on which to base the clinical practice of early routine grommet placement in children with cleft palate.\""
"\"[A systematic review of adenoidectomy in the treatment of otitis media with effusion in children].\",\"OBJECTIVE: Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis were conducted to assess the efficacy and security of adenoidectomy for the treatment of otitis media with effusion in children. METHOD: Based on the principles and methods of Cochrane systematic reviews, literature was searched in PubMed, Medline, Elisevier, Ovid, CBM, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang datebases. Randomized controlled trials about treatment of otitis media with effusion in children using adenoidectomy were included. Meta-analysis was performed for the result of homogeneous studies using RevMan 5.2 software. RESULT: Adenoidectomy (combined with myringotomy or puncture) was superior to non-surgical (combined with myringotomy or puncture) treatment in reducing the incidence of acute otitis media and removing the middle ear effusion. Adenoidectomy combined with tympanostomy tube was superior to tympanostomy tube alone in the removal of the middle ear effusion and improvement of hearing level. Three trials described some postoperative complications including haemorrhage, incipient malignant hyperthermia, postoperative pneumonia and velopharyngeal insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Our research shows a benefit of adenoidectomy in the removal of middle ear effusion in children with OME. Adenoidectomy combined with tympanostomy tube was superior to tympanostomy tube alone in improving hearing level. At present, there is no evidence of serious postoperative complications after adenoidectomy.\""
"\"Supplemental Project To Assess the Transparency of Reporting Requirements: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children With Otitis Media\",\"INTRODUCTION: Despite efforts to spur pediatric research, there is a paucity of pediatric-specific research data available to guide clinical decisionmaking. Searching the grey literature improves the identification of evidence not found in the peer-reviewed literature and may prove particularly valuable for pediatric research synthesis. The objective of this methodology report is to examine the feasibility and additional utility—in terms of impact on risk of bias and strength of evidence assessments—of comprehensive searches of trials registries to supplement the evidence identified in an ongoing systematic review on tympanostomy tubes in children with otitis media conducted by the Brown Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC). DATA SOURCES: We conducted searches in ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, using terms that matched those used in the original review database searches. RESULTS: Six studies were identified in both the registries and the original review. Overall the agreement for design, arm information, baselines, and results was very close, but prespecified outcomes in almost all of the records differed from the outcomes in the publications based on those records. Twenty studies were screened in via registry searches but not found in the original review. Two gave results, but we were unable to incorporate them in to the analysis, due to the fact that they had no statistical analyses. The results of these trials would not have changed our initial meta-analyses, risk of bias, or strength or evidence assessments. Seven of the records without results indicate studies with completion dates in the future or recent past. The information about these studies can be used to inform future research needs. We were able to find a registry record for only four of the 178 studies in the original review. CONCLUSIONS: This project yields limited evidence on the utility of searching ClinicalTrials.gov, because only six records were found that matched papers in the report, along with two others that yielded new results. Based on the evidence we found, there does not appear to be an impact on the conclusions or strength of evidence in the report of including records from ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. One way in which conducting a registry search is of value to a systematic review project is in identifying ongoing research, as well as gaps in knowledge, and facilitating prioritization of future research to reduce redundancy.\""
"\"Can meta-analysis help uncertainty in surgery for otitis media in children.\",\"While otitis media is perhaps the most common disease of childhood that receives medical attention, there is little agreement concerning the efficacy of the medical and surgical therapies employed to try to alleviate its symptoms or hasten its natural resolution. Because various surgeries including adenoidectomy, myringotomy, and insertion of tympanostomy tubes are frequently involved in the treatment of otitis media with effusion (OME), it is likely the most expensive condition being managed in national terms. In an attempt to elucidate the most appropriate management of this condition, a meta-analysis was attempted to the 12 randomized control trials of surgical treatments for OME in children, published between 1966 and 1990. Heterogeneity both in the populations and comparisons studied and in the outcomes presented made meta-analysis an inappropriate method for clarifying this area of clinical uncertainty. Important elements in the design of randomized control trials that should be included in future studies of treatment for OME are therefore discussed.\""
"\"Autoinflation for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion\",\"BACKGROUND: This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006. Otitis media with effusion (OME) or 'glue ear' is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, in the absence of acute inflammation or infection. It is the commonest cause of acquired hearing loss in childhood and the usual reason for insertion of 'grommets'. Potential treatments include decongestants, mucolytics, steroids, antihistamines and antibiotics. Autoinflation devices have been proposed as a simple mechanical means of improving 'glue ear'. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of autoinflation compared with no treatment in children and adults with otitis media with effusion. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 12 April 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials that compared any form of autoinflation to no autoinflation in individuals with 'glue ear'. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Eight studies, with a total of 702 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the studies were predominantly assessed as being at low or unclear risk of bias; unclear risk was mainly due lack of information. There was no evidence of selective reporting. Pooled estimates favoured the intervention, but did not show a significant effect on tympanometry (type C2 and B) at less than one month, nor at more than one month. Similarly, there were no significant changes for discrete pure-tone audiometry and non-discrete audiometry. Pooled estimates favoured, but not significantly, the intervention for the composite measure of tympanogram or audiometry at less than one month; at more than one month the result became significant (RRI 1.74, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.50). Subgroup analysis based on the type of intervention showed a significant effect using a Politzer device under one month (RRI 7.07, 95% CI 3.70 to 13.51) and over one month (RRI 2.25, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.04). None of the studies demonstrated a significant difference in the incidence of side effects between interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: All of the studies were small, of limited treatment duration and had short follow-up. However, because of the low cost and absence of adverse effects it is reasonable to consider autoinflation whilst awaiting natural resolution of otitis media with effusion. Primary care could prove a beneficial place to evaluate such interventions and there is ongoing research in this area. Further research should also consider the duration of treatment, the long-term impact on developmental outcomes in children and additional quality of life outcome measures for children and families.\""
"\"Grommets (ventilation tubes) for recurrent acute otitis media in children\",\"BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood illnesses. While many children experience sporadic AOM episodes, an important group suffer from recurrent AOM (rAOM), defined as three or more episodes in six months, or four or more in one year. In this subset of children AOM poses a true burden through frequent episodes of ear pain, general illness, sleepless nights and time lost from nursery or school. Grommets, also called ventilation or tympanostomy tubes, can be offered for rAOM. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of bilateral grommet insertion with or without concurrent adenoidectomy in children with rAOM. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 4 December 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bilateral grommet insertion with or without concurrent adenoidectomy and no ear surgery in children up to age 16 years with rAOM. We planned to apply two main scenarios: grommets as a single surgical intervention and grommets as concurrent treatment with adenoidectomy (i.e. children in both the intervention and comparator groups underwent adenoidectomy). The comparators included active monitoring, antibiotic prophylaxis and placebo medication. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were: proportion of children who have no AOM recurrences at three to six months follow-up (intermediate-term) and persistent tympanic membrane perforation (significant adverse event). Secondary outcomes were: proportion of children who have no AOM recurrences at six to 12 months follow-up (long-term); total number of AOM recurrences, disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life, presence of middle ear effusion and other adverse events at short-term, intermediate-term and long-term follow-up. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. MAIN RESULTS: Five RCTs (805 children) with unclear or high risk of bias were included. All studies were conducted prior to the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in the countries' national immunisation programmes. In none of the trials was adenoidectomy performed concurrently in both groups.Grommets versus active monitoringGrommets were more effective than active monitoring in terms of:- proportion of children who had no AOM recurrence at six months (one study, 95 children, 46% versus 5%; risk ratio (RR) 9.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.38 to 37.80, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 3; low-quality evidence);- proportion of children who had no AOM recurrence at 12 months (one study, 200 children, 48% versus 34%; RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.99, NNTB 8; low-quality evidence);- number of AOM recurrences at six months (one study, 95 children, mean number of AOM recurrences per child: 0.67 versus 2.17, mean difference (MD) -1.50, 95% CI -1.99 to -1.01; low-quality evidence);- number of AOM recurrences at 12 months (one study, 200 children, one-year AOM incidence rate: 1.15 versus 1.70, incidence rate difference -0.55, 95% -0.17 to -0.93; low-quality evidence).Children receiving grommets did not have better disease-specific health-related quality of life (Otitis Media-6 questionnaire) at four (one study, 85 children) or 12 months (one study, 81 children) than those managed by active monitoring (low-quality evidence).One study reported no persistent tympanic membrane perforations among 54 children receiving grommets (low-quality evidence).Grommets versus antibiotic prophylaxisIt is uncertain whether or not grommets are more effective than antibiotic prophylaxis in terms of:- proportion of children who had no AOM recurrence at six months (two studies, 96 children, 60% versus 35%; RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.65, I2 = 0%, fixed-effect model, NNTB 5; very low-quality evidence);- number of AOM recurrences at six months (one study, 43 children, mean number of AOM recurrences per child: 0.86 versus 1.38, MD -0.52, 95% CI -1.37 to 0.33; very low-quality evidence).Grommets versus placebo medicationGrommets were more effective than placebo medication in terms of:- proportion of children who had no AOM recurrence at six months (one study, 42 children, 55% versus 15%; RR 3.64, 95% CI 1.20 to 11.04, NNTB 3; very low-quality evidence);- number of AOM recurrences at six months (one study, 42 children, mean number of AOM recurrences per child: 0.86 versus 2.0, MD -1.14, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.22; very low-quality evidence).One study reported persistent tympanic membrane perforations in 3 of 76 children (4%) receiving grommets (low-quality evidence).Subgroup analysisThere were insufficient data to determine whether presence of middle ear effusion at randomisation, type of grommet or age modified the effectiveness of grommets. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence on the effectiveness of grommets in children with rAOM is limited to five RCTs with unclear or high risk of bias, which were conducted prior to the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination. Low to very low-quality evidence suggests that children receiving grommets are less likely to have AOM recurrences compared to those managed by active monitoring and placebo medication, but the magnitude of the effect is modest with around one fewer episode at six months and a less noticeable effect by 12 months. The low to very low quality of the evidence means that these numbers need to be interpreted with caution since the true effects may be substantially different. It is uncertain whether or not grommets are more effective than antibiotic prophylaxis. The risk of persistent tympanic membrane perforation after grommet insertion was low.Widespread use of pneumococcal vaccination has changed the bacteriology and epidemiology of AOM, and how this might impact the results of prior trials is unknown. New and high-quality RCTs of grommet insertion in children with rAOM are therefore needed. These trials should not only focus on the frequency of AOM recurrences, but also collect data on the severity of AOM episodes, antibiotic consumption and adverse effects of both surgery and antibiotics. This is particularly important since grommets may reduce the severity of AOM recurrences and allow for topical rather than oral antibiotic treatment.\""
"\"Tympanostomy Tube Insertion for Otitis Media in Children: A Systematic Review\",\"This SBU report reviews the scientific evidence for tympanostomy tube insertion in the tympanic membrane (eardrum) of children with recurrent acute otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear) or long-term episodes of secretory otitis media (with fluid accumulation in the middle ear). Although these conditions eventually heal, approximately 10,000 Swedish children a year have such severe problems due to episodes of pain, reduced quality of life or hearing loss that tympanostomy tube insertion is considered to be warranted. Conclusions The systematic literature review, along with a survey of clinical practice, generated the following conclusions.The scientific evidence for tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media is insufficient. Given that more than 2,000 Swedish children a year receive the treatment for this indication, reliable studies are needed as soon as possible. Tympanostomy tube insertion for long-term secretory otitis media improves hearing (strong scientific evidence) and quality of life (moderately strong scientific evidence) for at least 9 months. Treating children with this indication in such a manner is justified if they have objectively verified hearing loss and accompanying reduction in quality of life. Forms that have been tested for children with diseases of the ear can be used to assess quality of life. Adenoidectomy improves hearing at 6-month follow-up as effectively as tympanostomy tube insertion in children with long-term secretory otitis media (limited scientific evidence). Combining tympanostomy tube insertion with adenoidectomy does not lead to further hearing improvement at 3-month follow up (moderately strong scientific evidence). Suctioning out fluid in the middle ear in combination with tympanostomy tube insertion does not extend functionality or reduce obstruction of the tube. Routine removal of tubes that are not spontaneously discharged has not been shown to reduce the risk of complications. Bathing and swimming do not increase the risk of tympanostomy tube otorrhoea (discharge) (limited scientific evidence). Preventive measures such as earplugs or eardrops when bathing or swimming have little or no effect (moderately strong scientific evidence). The scientific evidence is insufficient to determine whether tympanostomy tube insertion is cost-effective for recurrent acute otitis media or secretory otitis media.\""
"\"Ventilation tubes after surgery for otitis media with effusion or acute otitis media and swimming. Systematic review and meta-analysis.\",\"OBJECTIVE: To determine if the use of ear protection when swimming of children with ventilation tubes modifies the risk of acute otitis media (AOM) compared to not swimming. METHODS: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Search conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library databases. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective cohort studies and controlled clinical trials of children with ventilation tubes, with a minimum follow-up of 2 months. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. RESULTS: 11 studies were selected. No difference was found in risk of AOM in children who swim without ear protection compared with those who do not swim: Odds ratio=0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.42-1.44; nor compared with those who use earplugs and swimming caps, odds ratio=0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.38-1.48; nor in those who use ear drops after swimming compared with those who used earplugs or swimming caps, odds ratio=0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.02. The use of ear drops after swimming increases the risk of AOM in children with ventilation tubes as compared with those who do not swim, odds ratio=3.14, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 7.05. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to suggest that protection when swimming with earplugs, swimming caps or ear drops in children with ventilation tubes reduces the risk of AOM. Ear drops may even increase this risk.\""
"\"Acute otitis media in children with tympanostomy tubes.\",\"OBJECTIVE: To review evidence regarding antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media in children with tympanostomy tubes and to discuss antibiotic resistance and ototoxicity. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for relevant articles. Articles providing level I evidence(randomized controlled trials) for treatment were used. Key words used in the search included otitis media(MeSH), middle ear ventilation (MeSH), tympanostomy tubes, and otorrhea. MAIN MESSAGE: Tympanostomy tube insertion is a common procedure; acute otitis media is a frequent sequela. Treatment options include systemic or topical antibiotics with or without corticosteroids. The development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and ototoxicity related to treatment are important considerations. There have been well-conducted randomized controlled trials of topical versus systemic antibiotic agents. Combined with proper ear cleaning and tragal pumping, topical fluoroquinolone agents offer the most effective treatment. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that a topical fluoroquinolone, with or without a corticosteroid, is the treatment of choice for acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes.\""
"\"Which children would benefit most from tympanostomy tubes (grommets)? A personal evidence-based review.\",\"UNLABELLED: Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a common condition in young children. OME causes some hearing loss, and can cause permanent changes in the tympanic membrane as well as other symptoms. In most cases OME is of short duration. As long-lasting bilateral OME for decades has been associated with delayed cognitive and language development, parents and ENT specialists have a positive attitude towards treatment with tympanostomy tubes (TT). METHOD: This personal evidence-based review is build on own observations and research combined with newer studies and guidelines. RESULTS: The review argues for a relatively restrictive treatment policy concerning the use of TT in children with OME without signs or symptoms of impaired social or linguistic function. CONCLUSION: Six months with bilateral OME and significant hearing loss should be present before treatment with TT in otherwise healthy children. At the moment we have no evidence for the subgroups of children excluded from the RCTs, i.e. children with speech/language delays, behaviour and learning problems, or syndromes. Clinicians will need to make their own decisions regarding treatment of such children. The situation just now is that some children are over-treated and some are under-treated. There is an urgent need for prospective cohort studies and randomised studies on children with long-lasting OME in an attempt to characterise the children who would benefit most from TT.\""
"\"Ventilation tube treatment: a systematic review of the literature.\",\"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to study the effectiveness of ventilation tube (VT) treatment in children with secretory otitis media (SOM), assessed by improved hearing, normalized language and quality of life (QoL), and recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM), assessed by number of episodes of AOM and QoL. Data Sources. Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched for randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials and cohort studies in English, Scandinavian, German, and French languages between 1966 and April 2007. Additional literature was retrieved from reference lists in the articles. REVIEW METHODS: A total of 493 abstracts were evaluated independently by 2 members of the project group, 247 full-text versions were assessed for inclusion criteria and quality using structured evaluation forms, and 63 articles were included in the review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that there is strong scientific evidence (grade 1) that VT treatment of SOM improves hearing for at least 9 months and that QoL is improved for up to 9 months (grade 2 scientific evidence). There was insufficient evidence to support an effect of VT treatment for rAOM. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether the design or material of the VT or the procedure used for insertion had any influence on the effect; however, there was some evidence (grade 3) that aspiration of secretion at insertion does not prolong VT treatment. Further research is needed to address these issues.\""
"\"A systematic review of the effectiveness of ofloxaxin otic solution for the treatment of suppurative otitis media.\",\"The objectives of the study were to determine the effectiveness and incidence of adverse events of ofloxacin otic solution for suppurative otitis media compared with other treatments. All randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized comparative clinical trials published from 1966 to 2000 using ofloxacin otic solution as one of the interventions were reviewed and data were extracted and analyzed. Eleven clinical trials (9 randomized and 2 nonrandomized) enrolling 1,484 adults and children were finally included in the analysis. Five studies employed clear concealment procedure in the allocation of treatment whereas evaluation of outcome was at least single-blinded in 6 trials. The probability of overall cure rate was higher with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution than with other topical or systemic antibiotics in 9 of the studies analyzed (OR = 2.67; 95% CI = 2.04, 3.50). Resolution of secondary outcome parameters evaluated at least 1 week after treatment was higher with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution: resolution of otalgia (4 trials; OR = 2.41; 95% CI = 1.2, 4.82); resolution of otorrhea (11 trials; OR = 2.78; 95% CI = 2.12, 3.65), and bacterial eradication rate (6 trials; OR = 3.86; 95% CI = 2.54, 5.87). A subgroup analysis of 4 studies comparing ofloxacin otic solution with antibiotic- and steroid-containing otic solution showed a higher cure rate for ofloxacin otic solution (OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.52, 4.90). Another subgroup analysis on 3 studies comparing ofloxacin otic solution with oral systemic antibiotics showed higher resolution of otorrhea with ofloxacin otic solution (OR = 2.78; 95% CI = 2.12, 3.65). Of 4 studies with data on adverse events, the probability of adverse events was lower with ofloxacin otic solution than with other topical antibiotics (OR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.19, 0.42). Subgroup analysis showed that 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution showed better results in terms of overall cure rate, resolution of otorrhea, otalgia, bacterial eradication rate and incidence of adverse events. Whether due to chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) or draining tympanostomy tube, the overall cure rate (CSOM OR = 4.86; with tympanostomy tube OR = 2.13) and resolution of otorrhea (CSOM OR = 4.42; with tympanostomy tube OR = 1.66) were likewise in favor of 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution. The studies included in this meta-analysis showed generally homogenous results in all clinical and laboratory outcomes analyzed, except for the evaluation of adverse events. The authors conclude that 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution is better than other otic antibiotic drops and other oral antibiotics in terms of overall cure rate and resolution of secondary outcome parameters. Estimates on the beneficial effects of ofloxacin otic solution are limited to the period of study included in this review.\""
"\"Effectiveness of Tympanostomy Tubes for Otitis Media: A Meta-analysis.\",\"CONTEXT: Tympanostomy tube placement is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to synthesize evidence for the effectiveness of tympanostomy tubes in children with chronic otitis media with effusion and recurrent acute otitis media. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in Medline, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. STUDY SELECTION: Abstracts and full-text articles were independently screened by 2 investigators. DATA EXTRACTION: A total of 147 articles were included. When feasible, random effects network meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Children with chronic otitis media with effusion treated with tympanostomy tubes compared with watchful waiting had a net decrease in mean hearing threshold of 9.1 dB (95% credible interval: -14.0 to -3.4) at 1 to 3 months and 0.0 (95% credible interval: -4.0 to 3.4) by 12 to 24 months. Children with recurrent acute otitis media may have fewer episodes after placement of tympanostomy tubes. Associated adverse events are poorly defined and reported. LIMITATIONS: Sparse evidence is available, applicable only to otherwise healthy children. CONCLUSIONS: Tympanostomy tubes improve hearing at 1 to 3 months compared with watchful waiting, with no evidence of benefit by 12 to 24 months. Children with recurrent acute otitis media may have fewer episodes after tympanostomy tube placement, but the evidence base is severely limited. The benefits of tympanostomy tubes must be weighed against a variety of associated adverse events.\""
"\"Grommets in otitis media with effusion: an individual patient data meta-analysis.\",\"AIMS: To identify subgroups of children with otitis media with effusion (OME) that might benefit more than others from treatment with ventilation tubes. METHODS: An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis on seven randomised controlled trials (n = 1234 children in all), focusing on interactions between treatment and baseline characteristics--hearing level (HL), history of acute otitis media, common colds, attending day-care, gender, age, socioeconomic status, siblings, season, passive smoking, and history of breast feeding. Outcome measures that could be studied were mean time spent with effusion (n = 557), mean hearing levels (n = 557 in studies that randomised children, and n = 180 in studies that randomised ears), and language development (n = 381). RESULTS: In the trials that treated both ears the only significant interaction was between day-care and surgery, occurring where mean hearing level was the outcome measure. None of the other baseline variables showed an interaction effect with treatment that would justify subgrouping. In the trials that treated only one ear, the baseline hearing level showed a significant but not pervasive interaction with treatment-that is, only with a cut-off of 25 dB HL. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of conventional ventilation tubes in children studied so far are small and limited in duration. Observation (watchful waiting) therefore seems to be an adequate management strategy for most children with OME. Ventilation tubes might be used in young children that grow up in an environment with a high infection load (for example, children attending day-care), or in older children with a hearing level of 25 dB HL or greater in both ears persisting for at least 12 weeks.\""
"\"Adenoidectomy for recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms in children\",\"BACKGROUND: Adenoidectomy, surgical removal of the adenoids, is a common ENT operation worldwide in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms. A systematic review on the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in this specific group has not previously been performed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of adenoidectomy versus non-surgical management in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 30 March 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing adenoidectomy, with or without tympanostomy tubes, versus non-surgical management or tympanostomy tubes alone in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms. The primary outcome studied was the number of episodes, days per episode and per year with nasal symptoms and the proportion of children with recurrent episodes of nasal symptoms. Secondary outcomes were mean number of episodes, mean number of days per episode and per year, and proportion of children with nasal obstruction alone. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. MAIN RESULTS: Only one study included children scheduled for adenoidectomy because of recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms or middle ear disease. In this study no beneficial effect of adenoidectomy was found. The numbers in this study were, however, small (n = 76) and the quality of the study was moderate. The outcome was improvement in episodes of common colds. The risk differences were non-significant, being 2% (95% CI -18% to 22%) and -11% (95% CI -28% to 7%) after 12 and 24 months, respectively. A second study included children with recurrent acute otitis media (n = 180). As otitis media is known to be associated with nasal symptoms, the number of days with rhinitis was studied as a secondary outcome measure. The risk difference was non-significant, being -4 days (95% CI -13 to 7 days). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence regarding the effect of adenoidectomy on recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms or nasal obstruction alone is sparse, inconclusive and has a significant risk of bias. High quality trials assessing the effectiveness of adenoidectomy in children with recurrent or chronic nasal symptoms should be initiated.\""
"\"Tympanostomy Tubes in Children With Otitis Media\",\"OBJECTIVES: The objectives for the systematic review are to synthesize information on the effectiveness of tympanostomy tubes (TT) in children with chronic otitis media with effusion and recurrent acute otitis media, summarize the frequency of adverse effects or complications associated with TT placement, synthesize information on the necessity for water precautions in children with TT, and assess the effectiveness of available treatments for otorrhea in children who have TT. DATA SOURCES: We conducted literature searches in MEDLINE(®), the Cochrane Central Trials Registry and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase(®), and CINAHL(®). Additionally, we perused the reference lists of published relevant clinical practice guidelines and narrative and systematic reviews, and examined Scientific Information Packages from manufacturers. Citations were independently screened by two researchers. REVIEW METHODS: Each study was extracted by one methodologist and confirmed by at least one other methodologist. Data were extracted into customized forms in the Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) online system. All included studies were summarized in narrative form and in summary tables. We conducted random effects meta-analyses of comparative studies that were sufficiently similar in population, interventions, and outcomes, and network meta-analyses to compare treatment alternatives across studies. Specific methods and metrics (summary measures) meta-analyzed were chosen based on available reported study data. The PROSPERO protocol registration number is CRD42015029623. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The literature search yielded 13,334 citations, of which 172 articles are included in the report. Overall, the evidence suggests that TT placed in children with persistent middle-ear effusion improve hearing at 1 to 3 months compared to watchful waiting, but there is no benefit at 12 to 24 months. TT did not consistently improve language, cognition, behavior, or quality of life. However, evidence is sparse, limiting definitive conclusions, and is applicable only to otherwise healthy children. The current evidence base provides little guidance for the treatment of children with cleft palate or Down syndrome. Children with recurrent acute otitis media may have fewer episodes after TT placement, but the evidence base is limited and there is insufficient evidence to assess the impact on quality of life. The benefits of TT placement must be weighed against a variety of adverse events. There is no compelling evidence for children with TT to avoid swimming or bathing, or use earplugs or bathing caps. Should otorrhea develop, the evidence supports topical treatment rather than oral antibiotics or watchful waiting.\""
"\"Grommets for otitis media with effusion in children with cleft palate: a systematic review.\",\"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: No consensus has yet been reached with regard to the link between otitis media with effusion (OME), hearing loss, and language development in children with cleft palate. The objective of this study was to address the effectiveness of ventilation tube insertion (VTI) for OME in children with cleft palate. METHODS: A dual review process was used to assess eligible studies drawn from PubMed, Medline via Ovid, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, and reference lists between 1948 and November 2013. Potentially relevant papers were selected according to the full text of the articles. Relevant data were extracted onto a data extraction sheet. RESULTS: Nine high- or moderate-quality cohort studies were included in this study. VTI was administered in 38% to 53% of the OME cases, and more severe cases appeared more likely to undergo VTI. Compared with conservative forms of management (eg, watchful waiting), VTI has been shown to be beneficial to the recovery of hearing in children with cleft palate and OME. A growing body of evidence demonstrates the benefits of VTI in the development of speech and language in children with cleft palate and OME. These children face a higher risk of complications than those undergoing conservative treatments, the most common of which are eardrum retraction and tympanosclerosis, with an incidence of ∼ 11% to 37%. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence-based information related to the selection of treatment for OME in children with cleft palate. Additional randomized controlled trials are required to obtain bias-resistant evidence capable of reliably guiding treatment decisions. The conclusions in this review are based on underpowered cohort studies and very-low-strength evidence.\""
"\"Surgical Treatments for Otitis Media With Effusion: A Systematic Review.\",\"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The near universality of otitis media with effusion (OME) in children makes a comparative review of treatment modalities important. This study's objective was to compare the effectiveness of surgical strategies currently used for managing OME. METHODS: We identified 3 recent systematic reviews and searched 4 major electronic databases. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized trials, and cohort studies that compared myringotomy, adenoidectomy, tympanostomy tubes (tubes), and watchful waiting. Using established criteria, pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted data, rated risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence of relevant studies. We incorporated meta-analyses from the earlier reviews and synthesized additional evidence qualitatively. RESULTS: We identified 41 unique studies through the earlier reviews and our independent searches. In comparison with watchful waiting or myringotomy (or both), tubes decreased time with OME and improved hearing; no specific tube type was superior. Adenoidectomy alone, as an adjunct to myringotomy, or combined with tubes, reduced OME and improved hearing in comparison with either myringotomy or watchful waiting. Tubes and watchful waiting did not differ in language, cognitive, or academic outcomes. Otorrhea and tympanosclerosis were more common in ears with tubes. Adenoidectomy increased the risk of postsurgical hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Tubes and adenoidectomy reduce time with OME and improve hearing in the short-term. Both treatments have associated harms. Large, well-controlled studies could help resolve the risk- benefit ratio by measuring acute otitis media recurrence, functional outcomes, quality of life, and long-term outcomes. Research is needed to support treatment decisions in subpopulations, particularly in patients with comorbidities.\""
"\"A systematic review of the effect of tympanostomy tubes in children with recurrent acute otitis media.\",\"OBJECTIVE: Documentation of the effect of tympanostomy tubes in children with recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM) is limited. A recently published Cochrane review on the effect of tympanostomy tubes in children with RAOM was based on only two studies. Could the documentation be increased by including other randomized studies? METHODS: A MEDLINE and EMBASE search for randomized controlled trials was performed and 143 eligible papers were found. Only five studies could be included. All five were randomized studies with a total of 519 children, four randomized by children and one by ears. All five studies had different designs and control groups, making a proper meta-analysis impossible. Three studies had an antibiotic treated group, two studies a placebo group, and two studies a no treatment group as comparison group. Outcome measures were rates of AOM or fraction free of AOM in six or 12 months. RESULTS: Between two and five children have to be treated with tympanostomy tubes to prevent one child from attacks of acute otitis media (AOM) in six months. Tube treatment could reduce AOM with about one attack in six months after operation. Six months treatment with antibiotics was not different from treatment with tubes. No study reported quality of life for child and family or parental absence from day care or work. CONCLUSION: Insertion of tympanostomy tubes or long-term treatment with antibiotics seems to prevent one attack of AOM or keep one child out of three free from AOM in six months.\""
"\"Grommets (ventilation tubes) for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children\",\"BACKGROUND: Otitis media with effusion (OME; 'glue ear') is common in childhood and surgical treatment with grommets (ventilation tubes) is widespread but controversial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of grommet insertion compared with myringotomy or non-surgical treatment in children with OME. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Trials Register, other electronic databases and additional sources for published and unpublished trials (most recent search: 22 March 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of grommets. Outcomes studied included hearing level, duration of middle ear effusion, language and speech development, cognitive development, behaviour and adverse effects. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data from studies were extracted by two authors and checked by the other authors. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 trials (1728 participants). Some trials randomised children (grommets versus no grommets), others ears (grommet one ear only). The severity of OME in children varied between trials. Only one 'by child' study (MRC TARGET) had particularly stringent audiometric entry criteria. No trial was identified that used long-term grommets. Grommets were mainly beneficial in the first six months by which time natural resolution lead to improved hearing in the non-surgically treated children also. Only one high quality trial that randomised children (N = 211) reported results at three months; the mean hearing level was 12 dB better (95% CI 10 to 14 dB) in those treated with grommets as compared to the controls. Meta-analyses of three high quality trials (N = 523) showed a benefit of 4 dB (95% CI 2 to 6 dB) at six to nine months. At 12 and 18 months follow up no differences in mean hearing levels were found. Data from three trials that randomised ears (N = 230 ears) showed similar effects to the trials that randomised children. At four to six months mean hearing level was 10 dB better in the grommet ear (95% CI 5 to 16 dB), and at 7 to 12 months and 18 to 24 months was 6 dB (95% CI 2 to 10 dB) and 5 dB (95% CI 3 to 8 dB) dB better. No effect was found on language or speech development or for behaviour, cognitive or quality of life outcomes. Tympanosclerosis was seen in about a third of ears that received grommets. Otorrhoea was common in infants, but in older children (three to seven years) occurred in < 2% of grommet ears over two years of follow up. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In children with OME the effect of grommets on hearing, as measured by standard tests, appears small and diminishes after six to nine months by which time natural resolution also leads to improved hearing in the non-surgically treated children. No effect was found on other child outcomes but data on these were sparse. No study has been performed in children with established speech, language, learning or developmental problems so no conclusions can be made regarding treatment of such children.\""
"\"Does early detection of otitis media with effusion prevent delayed language development?\",\"OBJECTIVE: To consider whether earlier detection of otitis media with effusion (OME) in asymptomatic children in the first 4 years of life prevents delayed language development. METHODS: MEDLINE and other databases were searched and relevant references from articles reviewed. Critical appraisal and consensus development were in accordance with the methods of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials assessing the overall screening for OME and early intervention to prevent delay in acquiring language were identified, although one trial evaluated treatment in a screened population and found no benefit. The \"\"analytic pathway\"\" approach was therefore used, where evidence is evaluated for individual steps in a screening process. The evidence supporting the use of tools for early detection such as tympanometry, microtympanometry, acoustic reflectometry, and pneumatic otoscopy in the first 4 years of life is unclear. Some treatments (mucolytics, antibiotics, steroids) resulted in the short term resolution of effusions as measured by tympanometry. Ventilation tubes resolved effusions and improved hearing. Ventilation tubes in children with hearing loss associated with OME benefited children in the short term, but after 18 months there was no difference in comparison with those assigned to watchful waiting. Most prospective cohort studies that evaluated the association between OME and language development lacked adequate measurement of exposure or outcome, or suffered from attrition bias. Findings with regard to the association were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support attempts at early detection of OME in the first 4 years of life in the asymptomatic child to prevent delayed language development.\""
